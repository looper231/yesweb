                Re:Zero âˆ’ Starting Life in Another World is a Japanese light novel series written by Tappei Nagatsuki. It started serialization as a web novel in 2012.
                The story centers on Subaru Natsuki, a hikikomori who suddenly finds himself transported to another world on his way home from the convenience store.
                The series' first four arcs have been adapted into separate manga series.
                An anime television series adaptation produced by White Fox aired from April to September 2016, starting with an hour-long special.
                Two original video animation (OVA) episodes were released in October 2018 and November 2019.
                In March 2017, game developer 5pb. released a visual novel based on the series.
                A second season aired in a split-cour format, with the first half airing from July to September 2020, and the second half airing from January to March 2021.
                A third season is set to premiere in <br>October 2024.
