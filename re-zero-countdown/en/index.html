            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>
                Re:Zero âˆ’ Starting Life in Another World is a Japanese light novel series written by Tappei Nagatsuki. It started serialization as a web novel in 2012.
                The story centers on Subaru Natsuki, a hikikomori who suddenly finds himself transported to another world on his way home from the convenience store.
                The series' first four arcs have been adapted into separate manga series.
                An anime television series adaptation produced by White Fox aired from April to September 2016, starting with an hour-long special.
                Two original video animation (OVA) episodes were released in October 2018 and November 2019.
                In March 2017, game developer 5pb. released a visual novel based on the series.
                A second season aired in a split-cour format, with the first half airing from July to September 2020, and the second half airing from January to March 2021.
                A third season is set to premiere in <br>October 2024.
            </p>
            <h2>The Countdown</h2>
            <p>
                On March 24, 2024 studio Kadokawa released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ5Vw6m2UU0">second video trailer</a> for season 3, which 
                included the release date October 2024. This little page is meant as a countdown to October 2024.<br>I will occasionally add updates regarding the series if such appear.

            <h3>Terrible, terrible news...</h3>
            <p>
                Several hours ago, S3E1 was leaked on trackers. <br>
                As a reminder: The first episode of Re:Zero Season 3 was aired on cinemas in Japan and USA and was supposed to be released on Crunchyroll later in August (iirc). However some french people thought
                that it's gonna take long... Yes, it's a french group that leaked the episode on the torrent trackers with french subs already in it.<br>
                This is a terrible turn of events. I am majorly disappointed in people yet again for not only ruining our anticipation but also ruining the animator studios that have put literal hours into it.
                It's even upsetting for me, because Arc 5 and Arc 6 specifically were my favourite arcs in the entire series and I've wanted to see them animated so much...<br>
                We can only speculate on how the situation will develop onwards, but on the bright side: at least the only episode that ended up leaking is the first, which was already premiered to the public in theaters.<br>
                Something tells me, that someone in the streaming platforms are to blame here...

            <h3>New Trailer!!! Episode Premiere!!!</h3>
            <p>
                7 days ago we've passed the mark of less than 100 days left until Re:Zero's airing month. Kadokawa recently released a new trailer which revealed one of the witches names as well
                as her voice. It's also known, that the first episode of season 3 will be 90 (!!!) minutes and is planned to premiere and Anime Expo July, which is VERY soon! It's really happening, friends!
                <br>And yeah.... Still no Arc 6 info...................
            </p>

            <h3>New trailer released!!!</h3>
            <p>
                4 hours ago Kadokawa released a new trailer for Re:Zero Season 3. It is for the most part a recap of previous seasons. Right towards the end we are teased about Season 3.
                Yet again we see no signs of Arc 6... Some think Arc 6 will be marketed as Season 4. As much as I don't like saying this, this plausible, since the only clue about Arc 6
                we have is just one poster, which features key characters for Arc 6. Will the Pleaides Watchtower gang make it to Season 3 or are we doomed to wait another several years?
                <br>Only time will tell!
            </p>

            <h3>New opening reveal?</h3>
            <p>
                It's rumoured that on July 4, 2024, at MF Bunko Festival, we will get a look into the OP and ED of season 3. If that is true, then it would serve as
                an important reveal to if Arc 6 going to make it to the anime or not. Still looking out for some clues, but no shot so far...
